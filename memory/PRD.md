# PRD — White-Label Multi-Tenant CRM ("Connect Pro - Zelix")

## Original Problem Statement
Clone/port a CRM web app to resell to other companies. Remove all original branding
(FinFlow/KM), add a Platform Owner super-dashboard to customise the app per company
(access/permissions, logo, app name, enabled modules). LATEST (2026-06): "Separate the
CRM from this web app to sell only CRM web app" — transform the app IN PLACE into a
CRM-only product (drop the education/finance modules), keep the multi-tenant white-label
Platform Owner dashboard, and rebrand the default to "Connect Pro - Zelix".

## Product Scope (CRM-only)
Exposed modules ONLY: Overview/Dashboard, CRM / Leads, Contacts (formerly Clients),
Messages, Activity Log, Team/Users, Settings — plus the Customize (branding) page and
the Platform Console. All education/finance modules (Transactions, Accounts, Invoices,
Students, Colleges, Admission Revenue, Sub-agent Ledger, Leave, Expense Approvals, Staff,
Office Overview, Categories, Quick Entry) are removed from the tenant surface (routes
redirect home; not in nav; not in the platform module catalog). Backend routers for those
areas remain mounted but are dormant/unreachable from the CRM UI (kept to avoid breaking
interdependencies; can be pruned later if desired).

## Core Requirements
- Port uploaded zip codebase into the environment. (DONE)
- Multi-tenant architecture — isolated MongoDB database per company + one shared platform DB. (DONE)
- De-brand all existing references across code, UI, PDFs, assets. (DONE)
- Default branding: "Edu Connect". (DONE)
- Platform Owner super-dashboard to manage companies, branding, modules, access. (DONE)
- Mock/bypass integrations (email, push, S3, WhatsApp) — keys missing. (DONE, MOCKED)

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI + Motor (async MongoDB). `/app/backend`
  - `db.py` — multi-tenant router. `gdb` = shared platform DB; `db` = context-scoped proxy to the current tenant DB. `ensure_tenant_indexes()` builds per-tenant indexes (best-effort/hardened).
  - `lib/whitelabel.py` — branding defaults, module catalog, `provision_tenant()`, tenant seeding.
  - `routers/platform.py` — Platform Owner console API (prefix `/api/platform`).
  - `routers/branding.py` — public + tenant branding.
  - `auth_lib.py` — JWT auth, tenant vs platform-owner scope resolution.
  - `seed.py` — seeds platform owner + default tenant on startup.
- Frontend: React (CRA). `/app/frontend`
  - `src/lib/branding.jsx` — React context applying dynamic CSS variables.
  - `src/pages/PlatformConsole.jsx` — super-admin dashboard.
  - `src/App.js` — routes `/platform` (owner) vs `/` (tenant).
- Deployment configs at repo root/backend: `render.yaml`, `vercel.json`, `railway.json`, backend `Dockerfile`.

## Key DB Schema
- `{DB_NAME}_platform.tenants` — company registry (branding, enabled_modules, status).
- `{DB_NAME}_platform.platform_owners` — platform owner accounts.
- `{DB_NAME}_t_{tenant_id}.*` — isolated per-company CRM collections (users, students, leads, invoices, transactions, etc.).

## Key API Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` — handles both platform-owner and tenant logins.
- `GET  /api/platform/tenants` / `POST /api/platform/tenants` — list / provision companies.
- `PATCH /api/platform/tenants/{id}` — update branding/modules/status.
- `POST /api/platform/tenants/{id}/reset-admin` — reset a company admin password.
- `DELETE /api/platform/tenants/{id}` — delete a company.
- `GET  /api/branding/public` (verify exact path in `routers/branding.py`).

## Credentials (see /app/memory/test_credentials.md)
- Platform Owner: `owner@educonnect.app` / `Owner@12345`
- Company Admin (default tenant): `admin@educonnect.app` / `Admin@12345`

## Status Log
- 2026-06: Ported + de-branded codebase; multi-tenant isolation; Platform Console (API+UI);
  dynamic CSS-variable branding; auth session desync fixed; deployment configs created;
  defensive MONGO_URL/DB_NAME startup checks.
- 2026-06: **Hardened tenant provisioning** — `ensure_tenant_indexes` now creates every index
  independently inside try/except with logging, and default-data seeding runs via
  `_seed_tenant_defaults_safe`. A storage-limited/full MongoDB (e.g. Railway free tier
  `OutOfDiskSpace`) can no longer abort provisioning or leave a company un-loginable.
  Verified via API: provision company → new admin login → delete. PASS.

- 2026-06: **CORS hardening for external deploys** — `_ALLOW_ORIGIN_REGEX` in `backend/server.py`
  now auto-allows `*.vercel.app`, `*.up.railway.app`, `*.onrender.com`, `*.netlify.app`
  (custom domains still via `CORS_ORIGINS`). Root-caused a "Can't reach the server" login
  failure on the user's Vercel frontend → Railway backend: CORS preflight from the Vercel
  origin returned 400 with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. Verified: vercel origin → 200
  with echoed origin; evil.com → 400 blocked.

### External deployment notes (Vercel frontend + Railway backend)
- Frontend `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` MUST be the backend's **public** Railway domain
  (e.g. `https://<svc>.up.railway.app`), NOT the private `*.railway.internal` hostname
  (browsers can't resolve it). CRA bakes this at BUILD time → redeploy frontend after change.
- Backend must allow the frontend origin: either the new regex (after pushing this code) or
  set `CORS_ORIGINS=https://<frontend-domain>` on Railway and redeploy backend.

- 2026-06: **Atlas 38-byte DB-name fix + tenant self-repair.** MongoDB Atlas rejects database
  names > 38 bytes; the natural `educonnect_t_<32-hex-uuid>` = 45 bytes → `AtlasError 8000`,
  which broke login (tenant scan threw `OperationFailure`). Fixes:
  - `db.tenant_db_name()` keeps the readable full name when ≤ 38 bytes, else falls back to a
    deterministic `<base>_t_<16-hex sha1(uuid)>` (64-bit, stable) that always fits.
  - `lib.whitelabel.ensure_tenant_admin()` + boot-seed repair: if a tenant's registry row exists
    but its admin user was never created (earlier provisioning failed on the long name), the
    admin user + defaults are (re)created on next startup so the company is loginable.
  - Verified on preview: owner + tenant-admin login, new-company provisioning, and deletion all
    work; all generated names ≤ 38 bytes.
  - MIGRATION NOTE: on non-Atlas Mongo where a tenant DB name was 39–64 bytes and already held
    data, the name now shortens → that data is orphaned. Only the *default* tenant is
    auto-repaired. Fresh Atlas deploys are unaffected (no prior tenant data existed).

- 2026-06: **Brand logo integrated.** Added the EDU Connect (by Zelix Code Lab) logo as the
  default brand asset: `frontend/public/brand-logo.png` (login + in-app BrandMark) plus regenerated
  `favicon.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `pwa-icon-192/512`, `pwa-icon-maskable-512`. Set
  `DEFAULT_BRANDING.logo_url = "/brand-logo.png"` in backend `lib/whitelabel.py` and frontend
  `lib/branding.jsx`; simplified `merged_branding` so an empty stored logo falls back to the
  default (companies can still override with their own logo). Verified on preview: login hero +
  logged-in sidebar both render the logo. NOTE: appears on the live site only after Save to
  Github + redeploy of BOTH frontend (public assets) and backend (branding default).

## Backlog / Remaining (P1/P2)
- 2026-06: **CRM-only transformation + "Connect Pro - Zelix" rebrand.** Trimmed backend
  `MODULE_CATALOG` + `DEFAULT_ENABLED_MODULES` to the 7 CRM keys (overview, settings, users,
  leads, clients, messages, activity); rewrote the Overview dashboard (`Dashboard.jsx`) to a
  CRM view (lead KPIs, funnel, recent leads + recent contacts); trimmed `App.js` routes,
  `AppShell.jsx` sidebar and `BottomNav.jsx` to the CRM surface; rebranded defaults in
  `whitelabel.py` + `branding.jsx` + `public/index.html` + `manifest.json` + AuthPage hero.
  Added idempotent startup migration `_rebrand_stale_tenants()` in `seed.py` that resets
  unconfigured education-default tenants (fingerprint: name "Edu Connect" / old hero /
  "Admissions & Finance Suite") to the new CRM defaults. Verified by testing_agent: 100%
  frontend pass — authenticated dashboard renders, sidebar shows only 7 CRM items, removed
  routes redirect to /, platform module catalog shows only CRM modules, login hero + tab
  title show "Connect Pro - Zelix". "Contacts" label used for the Clients module.
- P1: Wire real integration keys when available — Resend (email), VAPID (web push),
  S3 (file upload), WhatsApp. Currently mocked/bypassed.
- P2: Optionally prune the dormant education/finance backend routers + page files for a
  smaller codebase (currently kept, just unreachable from the CRM UI).
- P2: External DB capacity — user's Railway free-tier MongoDB is out of disk space
  (infrastructure limit, not a code issue). User must upgrade/clean up for full functionality.
